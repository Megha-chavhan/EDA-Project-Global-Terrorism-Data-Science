# EDA-Project-Global-Terrorism-Data-Science
An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on global terrorism involves analyzing a dataset that contains information about terrorist incidents worldwide. The project undertook a thorough examination of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), a repository containing detailed records of over 190,000 terrorist incidents spanning a period of four decades, from 1970 to 2017. It is maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland.

The project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset that provides detailed information about various terrorist incidents that have occurred globally. The dataset encompasses a wide range of attributes, including the location, date, type of attack, targets, casualties, and associated terrorist groups.The primary objective was to derive meaningful insights, identify patterns, and gain a deeper understanding of global terrorism dynamics through data-driven analysis.

The project involves key steps Data Loading and Inspection, Data Cleaning and Wrangling to refine the dataset, Use various visualization techniques to explore the data visually, Investigate trends in the frequency of attacks over time (by year, month, etc.), Explore the distribution of attacks across regions and countries, Analyze the types of targets and methods used in terrorist attacks, Visualize the correlation between different target types and attack methods, Assessing Casualties and Impacts, Generate correlation matrices and heatmaps to understand relationships between numerical variables, Visualize pairwise relationships between numerical variables using a pair plot.

This EDA of the Global Terrorism Database provides a valuable resource for understanding the complexities of global terrorism. The insights derived from this analysis have the potential to inform policy-making, shape counter-terrorism strategies, and influence international security efforts.
